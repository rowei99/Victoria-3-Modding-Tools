Definitely might work some of the time
The state assigning feature doesn't add the starting **"STATES = {"** or the closing **}**, so make sure you add those manually. The script won't automatically do UTF-8 BOM encoding, so switch it yourself. It should continue working after you switch it tho. The tag input field is used for both halves. I'm planning to add the ability to assign homelands in the state assigner but they're not in yet. I know the dropdown for selecting states is a bit awful and hopefully I can improve it soon.
